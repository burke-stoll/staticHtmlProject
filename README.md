# Pear

This is the launching kit I use on just about every project.

Includes:

- HTML boilerplate with simple pattern library
- OOCSS style kit using Sass
- Gulp setup

This is meant to be a starting point â€“ to help me kick things off and then get out of my way. It helps me utilize best practices, set up a good architecture/workflow, play better golf, and be more fulfilled in life (yes, all those things).
