# Contributing to Pear
Looking to contribute something to Pear? Awesome! This document describes how you can help.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Things to Know
Really good contributions are:

- Simple (no hundred–line mixins or crazy Sass)
- Focused, both in scope and aim (take one thing at a time)
- Adherent to Pear's [code guidelines](https://github.com/jrdnbwmn/Pear/wiki/Code-Guidelines)
- Fully tested

## How it Works
The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests, and submitting pull requests, but remember the following:

- Please don't use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Ping @jrdnbwmn on Twitter.
- Please don't derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
- Please don't open issues regarding third party code like Bourbon or Normalize (open them in their respective repositories).

### Bug Reports
A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repo. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thank you!

Guidelines:

- Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
- Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
- Isolate the problem — ideally create a [reduced test case](Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

### Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests
Good pull requests – patches, improvements, new features – are a fantastic help, especially when they follow the guidelines under "Things to Know."

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

This is the best way to do a pull request with Pear:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make your changes in a topic branch (off the main project development branch).
3. Test your changes to the best of your ability.
4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch.
5. Push your topic branch up to your fork.
6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description against the master branch.
